How to use with Claude Code:
- Mention the path in chat, e.g. `context/refs/overview.png` or `context/refs/mobile-home.jpg`.
- You can drag & drop into the repo, then move/rename here.

Tips:
- Prefer descriptive names: `overview-2025-09-01.png`, `calls-table-spacing.png`.
- For Playwright snapshots, you can also point to files under `tmp/`.
